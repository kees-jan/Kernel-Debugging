<h1>Oops!</h1>

For this exercise, I equipped the kernel with a dummy
device that is supposed to produce a few paragraphs of
prose. Unfortunately, I'm not all that experienced and have introduced
some bugs.

To test my device, please execute
<ul>
  <li><tt>cat /dev/sioux-lorem</tt>
</ul>
Please find and fix any bugs you encounter <tt>:-)</tt>
