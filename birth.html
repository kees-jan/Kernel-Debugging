<h1>Birth of the first process</h1>

Near the end of the kernel initialization <tt>kernel_init()</tt> is
called. It does some final initialisation and then starts the first
userspace process.
<ul>
  <li>Can you find where <tt>stdin</tt>, <tt>stdout</tt>
  and <tt>stderr</tt> are opened?
  <li>Which executable is started as the first process?
</ul>
For this exercise, you want to attach gdb to qemu before the kernel is started. In order to do this, pass the <tt>-S</tt> option to Qemu. This will tell it to <b>not</b> start the kernel until after you give the <tt>continue</tt> command in gdb.
